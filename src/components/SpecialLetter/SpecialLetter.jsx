      <p className="text-lg text-violet-900 text-justify my-4">
        I hope this letter finds you well.
      </p>

        I’ve spent some time thinking about a proper way to express what I have in my heart and it came to my mind that I could try words that may conform to what was stated.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-violet-900 text-justify my-4">
        It has really been a privilege to know you. I sincerely fell for your kindness, smarts and how you light up a room. Many men wish you were not standing beside them, but rather across from them.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-violet-900 text-justify my-4">
        All that said, I would like to ask you something important, although I do so with no pressure. I’d love to get the chance to court you, grow close to you and see where this will take us. I think there's something beautiful in spending time connecting to one another and building something meaningful together, slowly but surely.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-violet-900 text-justify my-4">
        This question is asked so you can get back to it whenever you feel ready—not because I’m expecting something from you. What makes you happy and comfortable is very important to me. I only wish for you to think and reply when you feel like it!
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-violet-900 text-justify my-4">
        I appreciate you reading this and, regardless of your response, I treasure our past moments and look forward to our future moments.
